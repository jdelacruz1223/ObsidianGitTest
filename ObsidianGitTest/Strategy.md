Dates: August 16th 2024 at 10:00 AM to August 20th 2024 at 10:00 AM
What's up: We have 4 days, more specifically 96 hours, to make a functioning, enticing game.
Obstacles:
	How will we split our time optimally to allow for both efficient working and ample rest?

Constraints: 
	I do not want anyone to work more than 8 hours

Breakdown:
96 hours
	8 for work
	8 for sleep
	8 for personal

!!! What people do outside of working is not my business. So I would require *at least 8 hours minimum* of work contributed. No one should work more than 4 hours straight and I would highly advise against working without taking at least 30-60 min of break between the 4 hour work blocks. If need be, I will cut off over
