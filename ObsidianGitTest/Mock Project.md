Artists should have their own branch that only reflects a small number of folders pertaining to only art assets. Art files can and should be places in these folders and pushed so that the rest of the team has access to those files without the Artists being able to modify any other components of the repo. Should importing issues or asset file properties need to be adjusted, as Unity usually needs proper initialization of assets (ie pixels per unit for sprites), Artists can communicate with designers regarding quality of assets or issues with them.

Tech artists in particular would be dealing with properly setting up assets to be in an out-of-the-box usable form. Programming isn't strictly required, but it is recognized when it comes to creating animations, which requires work on both scripting and Unity Animations. For that, a tech artist can communicate with Programmers to properly set up technical features.

Designers only have access to Unity Scene related tools. GameObjects, Prefabs, Assets, etc.. They should notify programmers when scenes are safe to modify to prevent merge errors and scene conflicts. Should component scripts or properties need to change, they can communicate with programmers to code them in. This can range from creating new properties, adding variables to specific component properties, or creating Serialized Fields for designer fine tuning. At no point should designers alone have to create new script files or code, but instead communicate with programmers for the creation of new features.

Programmers are responsible for connecting the assets and the logic of the gameplay. They have access to everything and are not limited to scripting but are not allowed to modify or delete files that are not related to programming. Programmers are also responsible with communicating with Designers to provide tools for them to use. When adding new features, they should firstly consult with the Lead Programmer in which the Lead Programmer will talk with the Producer for the go signal.
