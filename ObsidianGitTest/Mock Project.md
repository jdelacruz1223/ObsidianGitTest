Artists should have their own branch that only reflects a small number of folders pertaining to only art assets. Art files can and should be places in these folders and pushed so that the rest of the team has access to those files without the Artists being able to modify any other components of the repo. Should importing issues or asset file properties need to be adjusted, as Unity usually needs proper initialization of assets (ie pixels per unit for sprites), Artists can communicate with designers regarding quality of assets or issues with them.

Tech artists in particular would be dealing with properly setting up assets to be in an out-of-the-box usable form. Programming isn't strictly required, but it is recognized when it comes to creating animations, which requires work on both scripting and Unity Animations. For that, a tech artist can communicate with Programmers to properly set up technical features.

Designers only have access to Unity Scene related tools. GameObjects, Prefabs, Assets, etc.. They should notify programmers when scenes are safe to modify to prevent merge errors and scene conflicts. Should component scripts or properties need to change, they can communicate with programmers to code them in. This can range from creating new properties, adding variables to specific component properties, or creating Serialized Fields for designer fine tuning. At no point should designers alone have to create new script files or code, but instead communicate with programmers for the creation of new features.

Programmers are responsible for connecting the assets and the logic of the gameplay. They should only be responsible for scripts and any code/logic related components within the project. Access to other aspects of the project such as GameObjects, Prefabs, etc, is still allowed, but modification of anything outside of code and scripts should be communicated and only be modified in cooperation with the respective role involved. For example, modifying Scene components should be communicated and done with a Designer. Animation, as well, is to be modified in cooperation with an Artist. Sho
