Artists should have their own branch that only reflects a small number of folders pertaining to only art assets. Art files can and should be places in these folders and pushed so that the rest of the team has access to those files without the Artists being able to modify any other components of the repo. Should importing issues or asset file properties need to be adjusted, as Unity usually needs proper initialization of assets

Designers only have access to Unity Scene related tools. GameObjects, Prefabs, Assets, etc.. They should notify programmers when scenes are safe to modify to prevent merge errors and scene conflicts. Should component scripts or properties need to change, they can communicate with programmers to code them in. This can range from creating new properties, adding variables to specific component properties, or creating Serialized Fields for designer fine tuning. At no point should designers alone have to create new script files or code, but instead communicate with programmers for the creation of new features.
